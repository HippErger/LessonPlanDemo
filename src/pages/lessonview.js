          <b>What is Pantomime?</b>
          -Without any words, gesture for the students to make a seated circle
          on the stage.<br />
          -Gesture to them to begin silently copying (mirroring) your movement.
          <br />
          -Begin a pantomime of your choice (i.e. Waking up in the morning,
            brushing your teeth, opening the fridge and pouring yourself a bowl
            of cereal). Be precise and detailed.<br />
          -At the end, break the silence and ask the students if they could
          guess what you were doing.<br />
          -How were you able to guess the activities? What helped you figure it
          out?<br />
          -Many times as actors, we have to make the audience believe certain
          things exist that aren’t really there. This is called pantomime.<br />
          -Give an example of poor pantomime, brushing your teeth without
          clarity.<br />
          -Which paints a better picture, that or what I did previously? In
          pantomime, every movement should be precise, have a purpose, and help
          tell the story. <br />
          -Ask the students to try a Morning themed pantomimed scene while
          mirroring another.<br />
